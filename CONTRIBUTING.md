## Get started contributing

Detailed docs on contributing to Julia packages can be found [here](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/packages/?highlight=pkg#package-development).

### Code and docs
To start hacking code or writing docs, simply:

1. `julia> Pkg.add("GeneticAlgorithms"); Pkg.checkout("GeneticAlgorithms")`
2. ???
3. ~~Profit~~ Share with the world!

### Bugs, features, and requests
Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/forio/GeneticAlgorithms.jl/issues) when you encounter bugs, think of interesting features you'd like to see, or when there are important changes not yet included in a release and you'd like us to tag a new version.
